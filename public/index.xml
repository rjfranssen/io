      <description>So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve been leveraging GitHub Pages for publishing. This works great, but for blogdown we&amp;rsquo;ll start using Netlify. Let&amp;rsquo;s start RIGHT NOW with a site we&amp;rsquo;ve already built and published.
Pre-requisites     Pick either your postcards site, or your distill site from day 01. Refresh your memory- which repository was it again?</description>

 site header (set in config.toml), site footer (set in config.toml),  homepage (set in content/_index.md),  about page in the sidebar (set in content/about/sidebar/index.md), and  contact page (set in content/form/contact.md).  Read on to learn how to set up your social icons, and how to show/hide them.
Configure social     Wherever you end up wanting to show your social icons, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to start by setting up the links in your site config.</description>

About parametrized reports     This is a parameterized report written in in R Markdown. It consists of a combination of text and code chunks and uses R, pandoc, and LaTeX to connect to a data source, create visualizations, and export a single file to html, pdf, or word without changing the code.</description>

      <title>US Zip Code Choropleth</title>
      <link>/blog/create-map-based-on-us-zip-codes/</link>

      <guid>/blog/create-map-based-on-us-zip-codes/</guid>
      <description>First, it&amp;rsquo;s important to recognize that Zip Codes are not polygons - they are a way for the US Post Office to associate mailing addresses with a particular post office or metro area delivery station, like a lookup table. However, the US Census Bureau created the &amp;ldquo;Zip Code Tabulation Area&amp;rdquo; (ZCTA) to generalize an areal representation of Zip Code service areas. This post demonstrates how to create a choropleth map using ZCTAs, R, and the leaflet library.</description>

      <title>Create a Custom Color Palette in R</title>
      <link>/blog/custom-color-palette/</link>

      <guid>/blog/custom-color-palette/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m describing customizing my own color palette for ggplot2. This is based off of Creating corporate colour palettes for ggplot2 by drsimonj.
First, find a bunch of colors that you like. Canva is a good place to go for inspiration; or, use this tool from Adobe Color that will extract colors from a photo you like. Then, there&amp;rsquo;s always colorbrewer2.
In many cases, you can simply use scale_color_manual() and scale_fill_manual() functions directly within ggplot2.</description>
